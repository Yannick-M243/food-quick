------------------FOOD QUICK PLANNING----------------------

First, I am going to create 4 classes:
- Customer for customers 
- Meal for meals
- Restaurant for restaurants
- Main for the code and running the program
 
I have chosen to not create Classes for drivers and orders since I will read
drivers from the drivers' file and I will write the orders on invoice files.

Then I'm going to add attributes and behaviors for Customer, Meal, and Restaurants classes.
In other words, I will create variables, constructors, and a method to create new instances of each class.

After that in the Main class, I will create differents methods:
- one to read the drivers files
- one to find the nearest driver
- one to determine if the driver is too far for the customer
- one to write the invoice file

Finally, I will use the methods created in all classes in the Main class to create instances of objects
and to generate the invoice file
